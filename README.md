# Resources for Online Teaching

For teaching online, here are some tools that you can use to help make communication in the remote classroom a little more organized.

## Slack
### Headers
There are lots of resources that you'll be giving students during the day, so it's helpful to start your lesson off with a header. This should contain the pertinent information for that lesson and hashtags that will help the students when they search back.


#### Start of the Day
```
==========================================
Good morning! :sunrise_over_mountains:

w06d03
Monday, December 7, 2016

```

#### Lesson
```
=========================================
w01d02
Morning Exercise

Instructor: Kristyn Bryan

#w01d02 #morning-exercise #setup-for-success
=========================================
```

Note: It's also important to surround the header with something that will make it stand out (we use equal signs).

### Lesson Framing and Objectives
As you're giving your lesson, it is important to **visually** show what you're about to do by posting objectives or guideposts for the students. This is equally as importnat as giving verbal cues in the online environment.

### Directions for Students
The online classroom can be trickier than the in-person classroom when giving directions. Connectivity issues, distractions, etc. can get in the way of hearing verbal directions.

It is **very important** to have both **written** and **verbal** instructions _whenever_ you want the students to do something. 

To help directions stand out in Slack, you can use `>` before your directions. It will add a grey border on the left-hand side of your message.

- For mult-line directions, put a `>` in front of each line.

You could also opt to post an image of pre-written directions (see mac2imgur setup below to quickly make screenshots):

<hr>

### Keeping Tabs on Progress
To get a gauge on student progress, it helps to have the students click on a reaction (emoji connected to your message) under your directions to show that they are caught up. This will help you to know when you can move forward with the class / if there are people stuck, etc.

You can use :thumbsup: or whatever your team agrees upon, but the important thing to keep in mind is that everyone should use the same reaction so that it's easy to keep count.

<hr>

### Break up the Task
It's important to break up prompts for activities. 
- Have a main prompt for an activity. This is the one that you want everyone to complete.
- Have bonus prompts for the fast folks in your class. If everyone doesn't finish this, it's still okay to move on.

### Discussions in Slack
Students responding to prompts, asking questions, or starting new discussions in Slack is a normal occurance. To keep your classroom clean, encourage your studnets to **reply** to threads instead of making a new message:

![reply example](https://i.imgur.com/5FFajGA.png)

They can do this by hovering over the message and clicking on the reply bubble:

**NOTE:** Be sure to practice what you preach! You should answer questions by replying in a thread.
<hr>

### Screenshots

#### mac2imgur

1. Go to: https://github.com/mileswd/mac2imgur/releases/tag/b219
2. Download the zip file and open
3. Go to the `i` icon at the top of your screen. Sign in on your imgur account (or make a new account).
![mac2imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jEuHnH0.png)
4. To use, take a screenshot, give it approx. 2 seconds (you will get an alert on your screen when it's been pasted to your clipboard)
![alert](https://i.imgur.com/fd37vxW.png)<br>
You can paste `cmd + v` the link - it will automatically be saved to your clipboard.
If you're pasting it into Slack, the link will be displayed when you paste, but the image will automatically be displayed once you send it.

## Zoom

### General Setup
- All of the instructors should update their Zoom preferences to remove the chat option. Slack is the primary form of chat communication.
- One person will be the host (preferably and IA) and this person will have access to all functions of Zoom.
- The host can give permission to others to record.
- The host can assign a co-host (this person can record and will be defaulted as the host of the original host loses connection).

<hr>

### Students Participation
- People may ask about the ‘raise hand’ option, WDIR doesn't use it, but you can decide as a team what you'd like to do.

- If a student has a question during class, we encourage them to come off mute and ask.

- If a student's questions is very specific to their own setup and something needs to be handled immediately, have an IA work with them in a breakout room. NOTE: only do this if you absolutely have to. Doing so will be taking them away from the lesson.

<hr>

### Connectivity Issues
- If a student is having connectivity issues, they can shut off their video, but remain present. They should alert the instructor of this issue and then work to get a stronger connection (ethernet cable, call their cable company) for the next day.

<hr>

### Small Groups (Breakout Rooms)
- Only the host can create breakout rooms and move in-between them. The general recommendation is that the IA is the host and can set up breakout rooms for an upcoming activity. Make sure to do this manually as automatically creating breakout rooms will send your other host into one of the breakouts.

- Before you “Open Breakout Rooms”, alert the students that you will be doing this and say everything that you need to say to the class as a whole. Once you press the button, the students will be gone.

- When making breakout rooms, make more than you need at a time so that it’s easy to move people around if you need to. If the rooms are created before you “open” the rooms, then you can’t move people / open a new room. You’ll have to close ALL the rooms before you open a new one.

- If you need to get in contact with all of the students while they are in breakout rooms, post your message in Slack.

<hr>

### Privileges
- Host: Has the ability to mute/un-mute all attendees. Can also create breakout rooms and record the sessions. There can only be 1 host and this person has can re-assign host to another participant by clicking on "Participants" and then choosing the participant from the list, clicking on the down arrow next to their name, and clicking “Make Host.”

- Cohost: Has the ability to mute/un-mute all attendees. They can also record videos. There can only be 1 cohost and this access must be given by the host by clicking on a participant name and selecting “Make Cohost”.

- Recording: Anyone can be given recording access by the host.

<hr>

### Use Outside of Class Hours
- Students can make personal Zoom rooms, but free accounts only allow a room to stay open for 40 minutes. Just alert them of this restriction so that they are prepared to make another one if the meeting lasts longer than 40 minutes.

# General Rules

## Be Consistent
- If you're teaching a language like JavaScript, be consistent with using semi-colons, single- or double-quotes in your work. Whatever you choose (as a team) to do, keep it consistent.

## Screen Sharing
- When screensharing, make sure that your browsers and windows are set up how you'd like them to be seen by the students.
- If you are showing more than one window at a time, try to not have any windows overlapping - position them so that they are next to each other.

## Mute Yourself
- When you aren't giving instruction, mute yourself! Student don't need to hear your typing or breathing (or worse :toilet:) while they're working on their own.

## Text Editor
- It's easiest for students to see your code when your editor theme has a light background and highlights keywords.

## Notifications
- Turn off Slack notifications when teaching or make sure that your Slack is on your primary screen and you screenshare on your secondary monitor. Make sure that you TEST to make sure that you won't get notifications as you instruct.

- You can download the Muzzle app that will silence all of your notifications when you're screensharing: https://muzzleapp.com/

## Keep it Clean
- If you've posted something in Slack that needs to be edited, edit it! If you posted something that should be ignored, delete it. Keep your Slack classroom clean by being purposeful with what you post.
