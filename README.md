# Resources for Online Teaching

For teaching online, here are some tools that you can use to help make communication in the remote classroom (Slack) a little more organized.

## Headers
There are lots of resources that you'll be giving students during the day, so it's helpful to start your lesson off with a header. This should contain the pertinent information for that lesson and hashtags that will help the students when they search back.

```

Morning Exercise

Instructor: Kristyn Bryan

Markdown:  https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-remote-gizmo/tree/master/unit_1/w01d02/morning_exercise

Zoom: https://generalassembly.zoom.us/j/364840357

#w01d02 #morning-exercise #setup-for-success
=========================================
```

Note: It's also important to surround the header with something that will make it stand out (we use equal signs).


## Directions for Students
To help directions stand out in Slack, you can use `>` before your directions. It will add a grey border on the left-hand side of your message.

## Keeping Tabs on Progress
To get a gauge on student progress, it helps to have the students click on a reaction (emoji connected to your message) under your directions to show that they are caught up. This will help you to know when you can move forward with the class / if there are people stuck, etc.

You can use :thumbsup: or whatever your team agrees upon, but the important thing to keep in mind is that everyone should use the same reaction so that it's easy to keep count.

You can paste `cmd + v` the link - it will automatically be saved to your clipboard. 
If you're pasting it into Slack, the link will be displayed when you paste, but the image will automatically be displayed once you send it.
